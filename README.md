# Deepwater

## Description 
We have created a mobile application based on Watsonx.AI's Granite-3-8b-instruct model. Its main function is to provide recommendations for household water use from YF-S201 sensors and Wifi ESP32 microcontrollers that measure the flow of water consumed by each area of the house where water is used. The result is an application that allows the user to see how much water he and/or his/her family consumes for each area of his/her home and per day. With the database collected by the sensors, the chatbot can recommend and send alerts to the user on the efficient use of water. 
This technological solution mainly contributes to ODS 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), by promoting efficient and responsible water consumption through IoT sensors and customized recommendations based on AI. In addition, it directly impacts ODS 11 (Sustainable Cities) and ODS 12 (Responsible Consumption), boosting sustainable household habits, and indirectly supports ODS 13 (Climate Action), as reducing water consumption also involves reducing energy expenditure related to its treatment and distribution.

## Problem and solution statement 
Water waste affects the environment and household finances. The lack of real-time monitoring makes detecting excessive usage and leaks difficult, leading to inefficient resource use. To solve this, DeepWater is a smart app that allows users to track daily, weekly, and monthly water consumption, segmented by different areas of the home. It also provides an estimated monthly cost, helping to manage expenses efficiently. Additionally, it features an interactive chatbot that instantly answers questions and offers water-saving tips. For better control, the app sends real-time alerts when it detects excessive usage, allowing users to take corrective action and prevent waste.
